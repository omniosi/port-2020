              After repeated failed attempts to get the text-destructive animation just right, I was approached to create this animation. I worked directly with the ad publisher and nytimes.com to make sure that this home-page takeover ad performed perfectly.

            The attention to detail in this animation, the ability to get up to speed quickly, and work well within the newyorktimes.com submissions guideline, and finally, the quick turnaround on my portion of this project solidified me as a go to designer/developer for the Canon team at Grey New York. This led to my role in future projects as a Creative Technologist.

            <p>
              Part of my role as a Creative Technologist in advertising was evangelizing new technologies to spark our creatives. To this end, we created an <a href='http://www.psfk.com/2014/10/marriot-makerbot-grey-new-york-contest.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>internal design competition</a> to concept a physical object to benefit one of our clients. Every contest needs a prize, so I created a trophy that pushed the technology.

Printed the pieces of the trophy using the <a href='http://www.makerbot.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Makerbot</a> Replicator 2, including pegs and holes so that the final object can be assembled without glue.

            Housed in a clear plexiglass case, this Trophy was proudly displayed on the desk of the contest winner. The trophy iteself was good enough to impress the Makerbot people. For myself, I was happy to have access to a 3D printer and grow my 3D design skills.

              Splitting a custom illustration into a responsive, parallax-scrolling site made this project a lot of fun to work on. The small team of Art Director, myself as UI designer and developer, and a javascript developer, worked tirelessly on precise scroll-position animations while adding hidden easter eggs in the experience.

              Starting from the logo design for this stylish baby accessory brand, I was able to match a sense of fun with practically, which is exactly the brand ethos of the client. For this project, I created the logo and the site design, then coded the static site that was then passed to the Shopify/Magento developer to add the ecommerce code.

            The fun and versatile logo inspired new uses on the physical product; from labels and stamps to plans of a stuffed, plush toy. The website design immediately led to sales and was featured in press for the company.

              This design came from very little in the way of a brief; just a short description of the contest. This was a quick turn-around design project for a branded Facebook contest page. The design team consisted of myself and one other designer. The selected design would be developed by an outside vendor.

            This project was an excellent opportunity to design for Facebook. As one of two designers on this project, I was happy that my design direction was selected for the final build. I am most proud of repurposing elements of the Wonderbread logo as a framing device for images of their idealized customers and for pushing for a simplified navigation.
